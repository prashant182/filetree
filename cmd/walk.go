	Use:   "walk",
	Short: "walk allows you to recursively find all the files and directories in a given location.",
	Long: `walk command allows you to recursively find all the files and directories in a given location 
and export that information into either YAML or JSON format. It can be customized using either --json or --yaml. 
If you choose to include only a certain files in that walk you can provide the --contains flag. If you wish to remove extension 
from the output use --no-extn flag. 

Finally the output can be customized to show certain values. For example as the value for the filename key you can choose --show-size --last-modified,
by default the value is "true". if --dry-run flag is used to show the output on the console before checking out the file. --in and --out flags are used respectively
to consume input and output path.`,

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	walkCmd.Flags().String("in", cwd, "Path of the directory that you want to walk. Default is working dir")
	walkCmd.Flags().String("out", cwd, "output where you want to store JSON/YAML file. Default is working dir")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// walkCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
